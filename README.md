# phespro

Another PHP framework? Yes and here is why:

- Caches are bad -> No built in caches
- Minimalistic -> Most frameworks do too much
- Stable -> Because of its minimalism, updating to new versions should be easy
- Simple -> Easy to set up, easy to understand
- Modern -> Built with modern PHP (>8.0)
- Extensible -> Very simple to extend

## Setup

You will need composer for setting up Phespro (Composer installation under: https://getcomposer.org).
If you have composer installed, you can run the following command:
```
composer create-project phespro/project:dev-master your_project_name
```

Now you have a fully working project and start coding! Congratulation!
